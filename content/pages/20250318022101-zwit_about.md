Hi,

I’m Giovanni Crisalfi, a programmer with a background in pharmaceutical chemistry, now working in the R&amp;D software division of a life-science company.

My approach to code is shaped by a love for text, parentheses, and functional paradigms. Lisp and Rust are my languages of choice, though I’ll wield Python, TypeScript, or whatever fits the task at hand. I write this blog from Emacs, which has transcended the role of a mere editor, these days: it feels like a neuroprosthetic, an extension of my mind.

This is a place where I publish when I’m convinced I’ve stumbled upon something that adds to the collective consciousness of the internet, not just noise. The posts here are sparse, deliberate, and technical.

Welcome.
